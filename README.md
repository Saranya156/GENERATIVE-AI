FASHION MNIST USING DEEP LEARNING

              Fashion MNIST is a popular dataset for beginners to practice deep learning for image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images (60,000 training, 10,000 testing) of 10 different clothing items like T-shirts, shoes, and dresses. Here's a breakdown of using deep learning for Fashion MNIST classification:

1. Libraries and Setup:

TensorFlow/Keras: These are popular deep learning libraries for building and training models in Python. You can install them using pip install tensorflow keras.
Downloading the Dataset: Use tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data() to load the dataset directly within your code.
    
3. Data Preprocessing:

Reshape: The images are 28x28 pixels. Reshape them to a format suitable for your model (e.g., add a channel dimension for CNNs).
Normalization: Normalize pixel values (usually between 0 and 1) to improve training stability. Techniques like dividing by 255 can be used here.

3. Building the Model:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks. A typical CNN architecture for Fashion MNIST might include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, optimizers (Adam, SGD), number of filters/neurons, and activation functions (ReLU, softmax) to optimize performance.

4. Training the Model:

Compile the Model: Specify the optimizer, loss function (categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification), and metrics (accuracy).
Train the Model: Use the model.fit() function, providing training data, labels, number of epochs (iterations), and validation data for monitoring performance during training.

5. Evaluation:

Test Accuracy: Evaluate the trained model on the unseen testing set using model.evaluate(). This provides metrics like accuracy to gauge how well the model generalizes to new data.
